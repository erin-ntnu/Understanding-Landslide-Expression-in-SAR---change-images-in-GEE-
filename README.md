There are two GEE scripts for producing images available in this repository: 

A. SHORT: Change images only - S1 & S2
B. FULL: Change images, environmental context layers, and landcover classification

IMPORT GEOMETRIES: 
For running the SHORT script (change images only) - it is NOT neccessary to use the Imports code. 
For running the FULL script - it is necessary to first copy-paste the IMPORTS code into the code editor and convert these. Next, you can copy-paste the script into the code editor and run the full process. 

Time-series:

C. Time-series S1
